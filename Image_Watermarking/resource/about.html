<blockquote><p align="left">Data security is the essential in the
today’s world of internet and networking. Threat to the security means threat
to the organization. Now a day’s people are ready to spent thousands of money
in order to ensure high level of security. In spite of spending such a huge
amount of money, still the objective is not achieved because the data some how
gets in the hands of hacker. Hackers make use of different techniques and
algorithms to decode the data encoded by the sender. The only way by which we
can ensure data security is by making data invisible. This can be done by hiding
the message itself behind some other objects. Here we are achieving the data security 
through the technique of Steganography.</p></blockquote>
